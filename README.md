## Description

The Employee Tracker app is a simple content management system designed to help businesses maintain records of their departments, job roles, and employees. Users of the app can retrieve and update data through the command line. This data is saved to a PostgreSQL database on the backened of the app. 

## Installation

This app requires the installation of Node.js and NPM. Additionally, Inquirer, Express, and pg are dependencies. 

The schema and seed files included with this repo are written to be executed in PostgreSQL.

**Note**: Nodemon does not appear to be compatible with the version of Inquirer used in this repo. Please use Node.js as recommended. 

## Usage

The app is run by calling it on the command line. From there, users can use their keyboard to toggle through options, select options, and complete prompts.
